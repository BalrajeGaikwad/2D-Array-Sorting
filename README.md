2D Array Sorting
Sorting a 2D array can be done in multiple ways depending on your requirements:

1. Sort Entire 2D Array as a Flattened List
Converts the 2D array into a 1D list, sorts it, and reshapes it back.
2. Sort Rows Individually
Sort each row in ascending or descending order.
3. Sort Columns Individually
Sort each column separately.
4. Sort by a Specific Column
Sort rows based on the values in a particular column.
